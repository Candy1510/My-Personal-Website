                person. and although we didn't have kids together he treats my adult kids, 
                like his own.

                <p>This is a video I created for my Daughter's Graduation from Community Care College. 
                    It was my way of telling her how proud I am of her and how much I love her. 
                    It was the only present I could give her at the time, but it was the most meaningful one.

                This is a video of Simon Sinek speaking about motivation and how to inspire others. 
                Simon is one of my favorite public speakers and authors. I encourage you check out 
                his Ted Talks on YouTube. There is so much Truth in what he speaks about.
                I find him to be very motivational and inspiring. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
