        <strong>Interests and Hobbies</strong>
    </h2>
        <p text-align: left> 
            I have a wide range of interests and hobbies that enrich both my personal and professional life.
            Spending time with family, especially my four wonderful grandchildren, is one of my greatest joys
            and keeps me deeply grounded. I also have a passion for creative pursuits, including arts and crafts 
            such as painting, jewelry making, and sewing. These activities not only allow me to express myself 
            but also help me maintain attention to detail and creativity.

            In addition, I enjoy cooking, singing, dancing, and writing, particularly journaling and poetry, 
            as a way to nurture self-expression and emotional well-being. I value experiences that broaden my
            perspectives, whether it is attending cultural events like movies, concerts, and plays, or traveling
            to explore new places. My curiosity also extends to learning and technology, where I am 
            continually seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and embrace innovation.

            These passions fuel my creativity, strengthen my problem-solving skills, and foster meaningful 
            connections—all of which enhance my ability to contribute effectively in any setting.

    <h2>
        <strong>My Passion</strong>
    </h2>
        <p text-align: left>
                I am passionate about supporting individuals and families affected by mental illness,
                addiction, and homelessness. My dedication stems from personal experience, having faced
                and overcome similar challenges in my own life. Through that journey, I gained valuable 
                insights into the systemic barriers many encounter and the resources that can truly make 
                a difference.

                My ultimate goal is to leverage technology to empower others by creating apps and 
                websites that provide accessible tools and guidance. These platforms will be designed 
                to help individuals and their families navigate available services, recover from 
                difficult circumstances, and achieve sustainable self-sufficiency. I am committed 
                to continuously honing my skills and knowledge in technology and development to 
                bring this vision to life and positively impact those in need.

        <strong>My Inspiration</strong> 
    </h2>
    <p text-align: left>
        A significant source of my inspiration is my mother, whose remarkable perseverance left a 
        lasting impression on me. While raising my siblings and me, she pursued her education and 
        became a successful programmer, exemplifying determination and the transformative power of 
        technology. Her journey ignited my interest in technology and demonstrated its potential to
        drive impactful solutions.

        I aim to channel my love for learning, creativity, and technology into initiatives that help 
        individuals and families navigate life’s challenges. By developing innovative tools and 
        platforms, my goal is to empower others to overcome obstacles, achieve self-sufficiency, and
        thrive.
